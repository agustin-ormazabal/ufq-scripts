# Scripts from the Computational Chemistry and Biology Laboratory at the National University of Quilmes (@ufquilmes).

## Analysis
Scripts devoted to analyse MD simulations.

- `ad_hoc_pca.py`: Custom Principal Components Analysis (PCA) which fixes the center on the structure with the lowest average RMSD with the remaining structures of the dataset.
- `consensus_secondary_structure.f`: Employs BaRNAba to identify the consensus secondary structure from a certain trajectory.
- `dPCA.in`: CPPTRAJ input to perform a dihedral PCA (dPCA).
- `molecular_fingerprints.py`: Employs MDAnalysis to generate molecular fingerprints on a certain trajectory.

## Figures
Scripts devoted to generate figures starting from MD analysis.

- `free-energy-profiles.gnu`: Generates a multiplot for several free energy profiles. The inputs must be generated by the WHAM-DHAM-BAR.f script (see below).
- `frequency_per_position.py`: Reads a frequency-per-position input to generate a bubble chart.
- `graph_broken_axis.py`: Generates a broken axis graph.
- `histograms.gnu`: Generates a multiplot figure for histograms.

## Standard-MD
Scripts devoted to perform MD simulations.

- `const-pH-equilibration.in`: Devoted to perform an AMBER equilibration with a certain pH.
- `restricted-heating.in`: Devoted to perform an AMBER heating with constrains on certain atoms.

## Umbrella-Sampling
Scripts devoted to perform Umbrella Sampling simulations.

- `generate_WHAM_input.sh`: Generates the input with the proper format to be analysed by WHAM-DHAM-BAR.f (see below).
- `Umbrella-Sampling.sh`: Devoted to perform Umbrella Sampling simulations.
- `WHAM-DHAM-BAR.f`: Devoted to reproduce the free energy profiles from Umbrella Sampling simulations.

# Scripts from the Computational Chemistry and Biology Laboratory at the National University of Quilmes (@ufquilmes).

## Analysis
Scripts devoted to analyse MD simulations.

- `ad_hoc_pca.py`: Custom Principal Components Analysis (PCA) which fixes the center on the structure with the lowest average RMSD with the remaining structures of the dataset.
- `consensus_secondary_structure.f`: Employs BaRNAba to identify the consensus secondary structure from a certain trajectory.
- `dPCA.in`: CPPTRAJ input to perform a dihedral PCA (dPCA).
- `molecular_fingerprints.py`: Employs MDAnalysis to generate molecular fingerprints on a certain trajectory.

## Figures
Scripts devoted to generate figures starting from MD analysis.

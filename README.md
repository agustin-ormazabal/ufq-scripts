# ufq-scripts

Scripts from the Computational Chemistry and Biology Laboratory at the National University of Quilmes (@ufquilmes).

## Analysis
Scripts devoted to the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

- `ad_hoc_pca.py`  
  Custom Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that fixes the reference structure as the one with the lowest average RMSD with respect to the remaining structures in the dataset.
- `consensus_secondary_structure.f`  
  Uses BaRNAba to identify the consensus secondary structure from a given trajectory.
- `dPCA.in`  
  CPPTRAJ input file for performing dihedral PCA (dPCA).
- `molecular_fingerprints.py`  
  Uses MDAnalysis to generate molecular fingerprints from a given trajectory.

## Figures
Scripts devoted to generating figures from MD analyses.

- `free-energy-profiles.gnu`  
  Generates a multiplot of several free energy profiles. The inputs must be generated by the `WHAM-DHAM-BAR.f` script (see below).
- `frequency_per_position.py`  
  Reads a frequency-per-position input file to generate a bubble chart.
- `graph_broken_axis.py`  
  Generates a broken-axis plot.
- `histograms.gnu`  
  Generates a multiplot figure for histograms.

## Standard MD
Scripts devoted to running MD simulations.

- `const-pH-equilibration.in`  
  AMBER input file for equilibration at a specified pH.
- `restricted-heating.in`  
  AMBER input file for heating with restraints applied to selected atoms.

## Umbrella Sampling
Scripts devoted to running Umbrella Sampling simulations.

- `generate_WHAM_input.sh`  
  Generates properly formatted input files for analysis with `WHAM-DHAM-BAR.f`.
- `Umbrella-Sampling.sh`  
  Script to run Umbrella Sampling simulations.
- `WHAM-DHAM-BAR.f`  
  Script to reconstruct free energy profiles from Umbrella Sampling simulations.
